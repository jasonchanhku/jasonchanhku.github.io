# Project Introduction

![Sic_Bo](http://www.casinoreviewsquad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sicbolit.jpg)

This project was inspired by a past project where I developed a Martingale
betting strategy to ensure profits in the long term of betting **Big or Small.** 

However, the downside of that strategy was that one must have infinite wealth to avoid bankruptcy
as there is only so much of consecutive wrong bets one can get.

The downside of this strategy hence creates the need of a more selective and cautious strategy which is
***less volatile in terms of profit fluctuations.***



## Rules

This strategy is only interested in betting in either **Big or Small.** The other bets such as odd, even, etc are
irrelevant in this project. 

The following are the ground rules for betting on either **Big or Small:**
* Big: total of 3 dices must be 11-17 
* Small: total of 3 dices must be 4-10
* Any triples will be considered as a loss
* Payout is 1 to 1, i.e. you win what you bet.
