# My Background

Hi there ! I'm Jason, a Quantitative Finance graduate and Malaysian scientist working at Fidelity International Hong Kong.

I'm a scientist inside and outside of work to achieve one mission, **Predicting the Unpredictable**. I have always been fascinated
of how data can be manipulated and enriched in many scientific ways to discover ground breaking insights and predict the unthinkable. 

As much as this discipline is a science, it is equally of an art to me. From cleansing the messiest data to engineering new
relationships in data, I utilize data and technology creatively to paint the bigger picture.

# My Learning Philosophy

I'm an advocate of being strong in the ***fundamentals***. I love learning the math and theory behind algorithms and then bring them to live by coding
it from scratch. I like to learn the nuts of bolts of the algorithms as it gives me a full understanding of what I'm doing
instead of using it as a black box.

Besides the fundamentals, I also believe in ***application***. I believe in initiating projects that put my skills to the test
from end to end. Skills are nothing if one does not put it to use.

> What's a Batman with a batmobile who can't stop crime and what's a Superman with a suit who can't save the world? 

Lastly, I believe in ***lifelong learning***. I will keep up with the latest tech, methodology, and news surrounding my passion
as I believe this is how I will continue upskilling and truly ***age like fine wine***.

# Areas of Interests

I have interests in applying data science and machine learning in the following areas:

* Finance
* Mixed Martial Arts / Combat Sports 
* Neuro Investing
* Casino games
